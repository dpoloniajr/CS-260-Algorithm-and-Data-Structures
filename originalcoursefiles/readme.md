# CS 260 Final Project Guidelines and Rubric 

## Overview 

Data structures and algorithms are essential tools for anyone entering the field of computer science. These tools consist of specific patterns that, when applied correctly, solve problems. As a professional working in the field of computer science, you must be aware of the various data structures and algorithms that are available, and more importantly, when to apply them. Being familiar with different data structure and algorithm options allows you to solve problems efficiently, because you will not have to re-create a solution repeatedly. 


In this project, you will select examples from your coursework to showcase the knowledge and skills you have developed in this course. You will compile this portfolio of work in a compressed ZIP file that will include the sources codes for each of your programs. You will complement your portfolio with a reflection paper that defends the work and articulates the lessons learned from applying algorithms and data structures to solve processing problems. 


In this assignment, you will demonstrate your mastery of the following course outcomes: 

1. Apply appropriate data structures for effectively organizing data given the requirements and constraints of various problems
2. Implement technically sound algorithms that accurately perform required functions
3. Employ basic algorithms and common data structures in developing effective computer programs
4. Assess foundational algorithms and data structures for their use in solving processing problems

## Scenario 
The source data is a cumulative list of the monthly sales of surplus property items on eBid Nashville beginning in January, 2014. The interactive data sets are available online. 

For your final project, you will assume the role of a programmer at SNHU Software. Managers of eBid Nashville are looking for a program that allows users to access information on the items sold through the eBid website. Throughout this course, you will contribute specific functional components of this larger piece of software. You will not be responsible for building the entire project; instead, you will submit individual artifacts that employ specific algorithms and data structures to meet the requirements of certain features of the program. The requirements you will be addressing are: 
1. Bid ID Search (Module Three, Five, and Six)
2. Sorting by Bid Title (Module Four)
