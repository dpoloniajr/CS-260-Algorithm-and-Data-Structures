# Category 2: Algorithms and Data Structures

The artifact select for the enhancement in the algorithms and data structures category is the Hash Table C++ file for the Bid ID Search Structure assignment in the Data Structures and Algorithms course (CS260). The artifact was originally created in December 2020, consisting of data from CSV files, two C++ files, a C++ header file, and a selection of debug files. The purpose of the assignment was to explore hashing algorithms by implementing a hash with chaining of collisions for bids loaded from a CSV file. Once the C++ project was created and the appropriate compiler was chosen, the storage structure needed to be defined. The options were between an array or a vector for the storage.!


### The Hashtable.cpp class file was selected to demonstrate the following: 
#### Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts by: 

1. Implementing a balanced binary tree structure to enable efficient ordered data storage and retrieval.
2. Developing insertion algorithms that maintain the balance of the tree, ensuring the time it takes to complete the operation increases logarithmically in relation to the size of the input data.
3.	Creating a range query method that efficiently finds all bids within a given range, leveraging the ordered nature of the tree.

#### Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices (data structures and algorithms) by: 

1.	Enhancing the data structure from a simple hash table to a balanced binary tree, such as an AVL tree, to manage algorithmic complexity and improve performance scalability. 
2.	Ensuring data integrity and security by implementing a binary tree structure that adheres to industry standards and practices.
3.	Transition the underlying data structure to a balanced binary tree to evaluate and optimize the trade-offs between data retrieval latency and structure organization.


#### The enhancements made to transition the existing program to balanced search tree (BST), with insertion and a range query method, demonstrates a variety of skills and abilities to databases such as:
1.	Understanding of data structures by showing a deep understanding of different data structures and their respective advantages and disadvantages. This is critical in database design, where the choice of data structure can significantly affect performance and storage efficiency.
2.	Algorithmic complexity management in the ‘0(log n)’ complexity, used for insertion, deletion, and search operations. Understanding and managing this complexity is necessary to ensure the performance of database operations, especially when dealing with large datasets.
3.	Performance optimization through an optimized query performance. Balanced BSTs can enhance search performance over hash tables when it comes to range queries or ordered data retrieval, which are common in databases.

   
#### Enhancements to the artifact include the following: 
1.	Created the header declaration for the binary tree C++ file with the binary tree file name.
2.	Created a node structure and defined the class that includes the key, value, and pointers.
3.	Implemented the necessary operations for the balanced binary tree, including insertions, deletions, balancing logic, and range query.
4.	Created the main function section with a display, load, and strDouble function.
5.	Implemented static methods for testing.
6.	Created a header declaration for the CSVparser.cpp file.
