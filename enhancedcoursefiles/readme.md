# Category 2: Algorithms and Data Structures

The artifact select for the enhancement in the algorithms and data structures category is the Hash Table C++ file for the Bid ID Search Structure assignment in the Data Structures and Algorithms course (CS260). The artifact was originally created in December 2020, consisting of data from CSV files, two C++ files, a C++ header file, and a selection of debug files. The purpose of the assignment was to explore hashing algorithms by implementing a hash with chaining of collisions for bids loaded from a CSV file. Once the C++ project was created and the appropriate compiler was chosen, the storage structure needed to be defined. The options were between an array or a vector for the storage.!


### The Hashtable.cpp class file was selected to demonstrate the following: 
#### 1. Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts by:
a.	Using a test instance for privacy and data protection
b.	Using a test instance to simulate cyber attacks
c.	Using a test instance for learning and innovation

#### 2.	The development of a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources by:
a.	Promoting secure development lifecycle practices
b.	Enforcing the principle of least privilege
c.	Facilitating test environments for security audits and penetration testing

#### The enhancements made to implement a test configuration and test instance in the CRUD Python Script, along with its corresponding Dashboard class file and test script, demonstrate a variety of skills and abilities to databases such as:
1.	Database management by creating database schemas for different environments and designing test data that reflects production data structures without using real data.
2.	Database system design by creating a modular design that allows switching between different configurations, in this case a test configuration and instance.
3.	Database collaboration by documenting code files in a way to allow for cross-functional team collaboration for development, security, and operations.
   
#### Enhancements to the artifact include the following: 
1.	Incorporating a test mode configuration parameter within the AnimalShelter Python file, which runs the instance in test mode if test mode = true.
2.	Importing the use of Mongomock in the CrudModule class file, which is used to for in-memory database access in testing environments.
3.	 Incorporating test credentials for database access authentication.
4.	Separate test scripts for testing in production and development environments.
5.	The replacement of the printing statement for logging, which is a more suitable solution for the use of development and production environments, making outputs cleaner.
6.	The replacement of block exceptions with catch specific exceptions, which helps with debugging by providing more information on errors as they arise.
